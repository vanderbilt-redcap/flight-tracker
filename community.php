Priority will be given to projects through a blend of group prioritization, ease of implementation, and current work plan.</li>\n";

When the software is broadly released upon the end of the pilot, individualized consultation with the Flight Tracker development team will be offered by the <a href='mailto:datacore@vumc.org'>Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Data Core</a> at a fixed hourly rate. The programming of the changes still must be completed by your local development team.</li>\n";
