<h3>Missingness Report</h3>

<p>The completeness of the database (or lack thereof) tells how reliable your data are. They can also tell if you need to adopt other measures to collect certain fields. (For example, you might look for an alternate data source to import or send out another survey.)</p>

<p>The Missingness Report (available via the View menu) tells what holes in the summaries of important data exist. This information is calculated in real time from more than one data source, so calling up this page could take a few minutes. This page displays in a table with one scholar per row and one column for each important data field.</p> 

<p>This page is color-coded so that you can make a quick assessment about how complete your database is. Red indicates that the data are missing for that value. Green, yellow, and purple all indicate that the data exist in some form. Green indicates that the data point is self-reported; yellow, the data point is computer-reported; and purple, the data point comes from manual entry. A lot of red indicates many holes in your data. A lot of green, yellow, or purple indicates that data exist for the most part. A lot of green indicates that your data are primarily self-reported, which is considered as highly reliable.</p>
