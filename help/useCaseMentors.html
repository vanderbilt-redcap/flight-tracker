<h3>Use Case: Mentoring</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: You give out annual awards to your senior faculty for mentoring. How can you see who has been doing the most in terms of quantity and quality?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: There are two easy ways to judge mentor performance – by the number of mentees (quantity) and by the conversion ratio of the mentees (quality). To see these lists, go to the <b>View</b> menu, and click on <b>Mentor Performance</b>. In automated surveys, scholars report data about mentoring relationships or you can enter it manually.</p>

<p>As alluded to above, there are two ways to view this table, sorted by the number of mentees or by the conversion ratio of the mentees. The information in the table is exactly the same; only the order of rows changes. As detailed in the Codebook, the conversion status is calculated for each scholar. Those still on a K are not placed in the numerator or denominator. Those who converted (denoted “R”) are placed both in the numerator and denominator. Those who have not converted but are no longer on a K grant (denoted “off K”) are placed only in the denominator.</p>
