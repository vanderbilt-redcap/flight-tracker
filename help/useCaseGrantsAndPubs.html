<h3>Use Case: Publications and Grants</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: You want to understand the correlation between publications and grants for your scholars.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: This task can easily be achieved for individual scholars by looking at the <b>Scholar Profiles</b> under the <b>Scholars</b> menu. The timeline will show when individual publications were published â€“ but only after authentication by the <b>Publication Wrangler</b> has taken place. The timeline will also show when grants were started and finished during this time.</p>

<p>At a group level, one can form two cohorts and compare them. To form a cohort, go to the <b>Cohorts / Filtering</b> menu and select <b>Add a New Cohort</b>. (See instructions on forming a cohort according to your parameters in <a href='launchHelp("useCaseBins.html");'>Use Case: Organizing Grants into Types</a>.) Then you can go to the <b>Dashboards</b> menu and select the type of metrics you desire. On the left navigation menu, you can select the cohort you wish to view results for.</p>
