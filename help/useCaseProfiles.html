<h3>Use Case: Scholar Profiles</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: An individual scholar seems to be falling off course and may have trouble achieving an individual K after her or his K12 ends or may not convert to R01 in time for her or his tenure review. You would like to notify her/his program director or mentor and include information about the resources she/he has used or not used.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: There are several pieces of information that Flight Tracker can provide for the affected scholar. First, we can consult the Scholar’s individual profile in order to see a timeline of her/his grants and publications. This information is available via our <b>Scholars</b> &rarr; Scholar Profiles page. This page contains some summary information about the scholar followed by more detailed information on grants and publications, the two main measurable deliverables a scholar has. Here, we also can see a timeline of publications and grants.</p>

<p><img alt='Scholar Profile picture'></p>

<p>Remember that information about these publications and grants ideally are approved by the data wrangling process. If publications are not approved or if grants are applied to the wrong person, this timeline can be rendered meaningless! The <b>Grant Wrangler</b> and the <b>Publication Wrangler</b>, therefore, are placed below on the Scholar profile page in case you need to look at the original data to check accuracy.</p>

<p>Finally, there exists a <b>Data Source Comparison</b> at the bottom of the Scholar Profile. This information allows you to quickly see which grants are in use (green) and where there might be conflicting information among data sources (red). Therefore, you can judge the integrity of the data.</p>

<p>We can use the profile to determine which type of K grant he or she is on, and then use the top summary (in blue) to view which mentors this person has recorded.  We can then communicate with the person’s mentor or (if on a K12 or internal K) program director.</p>

<p>Finally, the top summary also contains a list of resources and other resources the scholar has used. This can tell us if he or she has been taking full advantage of the resources offered at the institution, and if he or she might be encouraged to use more either by our office or the mentor/program director.</p>
