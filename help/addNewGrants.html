<h3>Importing Old Grant Data and Adding New Grants</h3>

<p>Federal grants are imported via downloads from the Federal RePORTER and the NIH ExPORTER. However, the following issues limit this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal grants and grants where the scholar is not the PI (e.g., K12) aren’t usually tracked by the federal databases.</li>
<li>Grants from foundations aren’t tracked either.</li>
<li>Grants from more than 10 years ago do not always appear in the federal databases.</li>
</ul>

<p>An internal database can supplement these. To provide a live database connection, please see <a href='launchHelp("useCaseConversion.html");'>Adding New Data Sources</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can enter <b>Custom Grants</b> manually via REDCap or via a spreadsheet program.</p>

<p>To enter grant information, one at a time, via REDCap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <b>Wrangle</b> menu and then click <b>Add a Custom Grant</b>.</li>
<li>Select the record you intend to add grant information to.</li>
<li>Enter as much information as you can about this grant. The <b>Start Date</b> and the <b>Grant Type</b> are especially important fields.</li>
<li>These data will be re-summarized by the overnight script, so you’ll have to wait until the next morning to see these in your summaries.</li>

<p>To enter grant information in bulk via a spreadsheet program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <b>Wrangle</b> menu and then click <b>Add Custom Grants by Bulk</b>.</li>
<li>Download the <b>template</b> specified as a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) document. Open this document using your spreadsheet program.</li>
<li>Enter in as much information as you can about this grant. The <b>Start Date</b> and the <b>Grant Type</b> are especially important fields.</li>
<li>Save the file and upload the CSV when finished. Click the Upload button to submit the file.</li>
<li>If there are any errors in your upload process, the website will tell you now. You may have to edit your spreadsheet a few times before getting the data into the right format.</li>
<li>Once processed and accepted, these data will be re-summarized by the overnight script, so you’ll have to wait until the next morning to see these in your summaries.</li>
</ol>
