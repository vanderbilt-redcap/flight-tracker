<h3>Use Case: Demographics</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: Someone asks for the percentage of underrepresented minority group members (URMs) who have MD degrees in your faculty.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: First, you can form a cohort (using the <b>Cohorts / Filtering</b> menu and the item <b>Add a Cohort</b>). The cohort consists of underrepresented minority group members. Therefore, the admission criteria consist of who is in a URM group. The criteria are OR-ed together, and all of the non-Caucasian minority groups should be included. (Only five criteria can be added at the present time.) Title the cohort “URMs.”</p>

<p>Second, you can view the demography for this consult. Go to the <b>View</b> menu and select the <b>Demographics Table</b>. Then select the cohort that you just formed (entitled “URMs”) and scroll down to see which percentage has MD degrees. Since you are unsure as to whether they ask for only MD degrees or MD degrees plus another degree, you can add up the rows for MD + PhD, MD + other, and MD only. You can report both this number and the number next to MD only.</p>
