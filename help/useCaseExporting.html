<h3>Use Case: Exporting Data</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: A biostatistician wants to correlate the receipt of R01 or equivalent grants with publication patterns. She asks for your data in a format that R can access. What do you do?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: There are three items that you might find helpful to share with your statistician.</p>

<p>First, you can give her access to the REDCap project (under <b>User Rights</b> within the project itself), including API Tokens. The tell her to access the REDCap menu’s <b>API Playground</b>. This page will help you generate code to export your records in the R programming language. (There are other languages supported.)</p>

<p>Second, you can download the <b>Data Dictionary</b> from REDCap in the form of a CSV spreadsheet. This can be opened by almost all major spreadsheet programs. This will provide some definitions to the variables.</p>

<p>Finally, you might be interested in sharing the <a href='launchHelp("Codebook");'>Flight Tracker’s Codebook</a>, which contains definitions of how certain variables are calculated.</p>
