<h3>The Departure of Scholars</h3>

<p>As we all know, scholars sometimes leave an institution for other opportunities. We often need or want to know their track of academic advancement, grants, or publication record. Because they exist outside of the home institution, these data are often imprecise and have holes in them. Nonetheless, keeping a few data points is a helpful practice so that the software can automatically update its database.</p>

<p>In core REDCap, the <b>identifiers</b> form contains a section entitled <b>Left Institution</b> information. In particular, the most important information is the Destination field. This field is used to identify the correct person in PubMed, in the Federal RePORTER, and in the NIH ExPORTER. It can contain the name of more than one institution (separated by commas). The institution name should take the form of the official name in PubMed or Federal grants. For us, this means Vanderbilt (which covers Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University Medical Center) instead of the acronym VUMC or VU. Partial name matches are permitted.</p>

<p>Other fields are kept track of as well. The job title at the destination, the date the scholar left the institution, and the type of job that the scholar took proved especially helpful for our tracking.</p>

<p>We are currently working on hooking up the database for our medical centerâ€™s office of Faculty Affairs. We hope to automatically populate some of this information from their database. In like manner, your IT department can extend our setup to meet your needs. (See <a href='launchHelp("addNewDataSources.html");'>Adding New Data Sources</a>.)</p>
