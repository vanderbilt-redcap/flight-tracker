<h3>Manual Curation: Publication Wrangler</h3>

<p>Publication Wrangling is an <i>opt-in</i> process where every publication must be approved as being a valid name match. False positive name matches are too frequent to allow them to go unreviewed. Publications are matched because one name matches with a scholar’s name, and one institution on the paper matches with one of the scholar’s institutions. A scholar’s institutions are from the project’s setup plus any Position Change forms or surveys on that scholar’s record that contain another institution.</p>

<p>If the scholar has an ORCID identifier on file (which may be downloaded from a weekly sweep of the ORCID database), PubMed will be searched, and any publications from that ORCID ID will be downloaded and accepted as wrangled. Thus, no need for manual confirmation of those. However, ORCID implementation is not complete (yet), so name searching is often the only way to retrieve publications.</p>

<p>PubMed only lists institutions for middle authors after January 1, 2014, so data quality improves significantly after 2013. For older publications (2013 and before), it’s recommended to provide a list of PMIDs or PMCIDs in the Publication Wrangling process. PMIDs or PMCIDs can be found from an author’s  CV or from a PubMed search.</p>

<p>Publication Wrangling is a two-step process. The first step involves screening names. Names that are longer (5+ characters) and uncommon are less likely to produce false positives. Therefore, Flight Tracker uses the 2010 US Census to recommend automatic acceptance last names used less than 200,000 times in that year. These show up with a green check mark. You can override this recommendation if desired (<i>e.g.</i>, if there are too many publications than is reasonable).</p>

<p>Common or short names are marked with a yellow/brown hand, indicating a need for manual checking. It’s recommended that the more common Asian names undergo a manual check because these names are overrepresented in scholarly populations (and thus more likely to produce a false positive). You can choose to manually review publications from scholars who you know are likely to be falsely matched (<i>e.g.</i>, John Smith and Johnny Smith are both at your institution). The Auto-Approve button at the bottom of the page approves publications for all the green checks.</p>

<p>The second step consists of a manual check for the publications of scholars with the hand icon – only if a new publication has been downloaded. You will be presented with new publications for scholars. Each new publication has its citation along with links for further information. The most helpful link is the one to PubMed, where you can review the author list and identify, by a manual institution match, that the author is the correct scholar. Oftentimes, improper name variations can be quickly weeded out. (<i>E.g.</i>, an author’s record might indicate she publishes under KE Hartmann and not K Hartmann. Thus, all citations with K Hartmann can be unchecked.) The goal is to weed out bad matches quickly while giving the scholar as much credit as possible. Click the green Finalize Publications button when complete.</p>

<p>You can add publications above the new publication by providing a PMID or PMCID and searching for that reference. You can even put in a list of PMIDs or PMCIDs all at once (<i>i.e.</i>, in “bulk”). These can then be added to the scholar’s list.</p>

<p>Finally, an “exclude list” lies at the top of this page. This automatically tries to filter out any name mismatches on the next download. Thus, using a prior example, K Hartmann can be excluded every time she appears, leaving only KE Hartmann’s publications. This is particularly when many mismatches occur. A comma separates these names in a list.</p>
