<h3>Use Case: Resource Effectiveness</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: You want to rank which faculty resources lead to more grant funding.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: Resource use can easily be analyzed using Flight Tracker, but first you must set them up properly.</p>

<p>First, ensure that you have the right resources set up in Flight Tracker. Go to the <b>Resources</b> menu and click on <b>Manage</b>. Here, you can see how well attended each session is. If you scroll over the number of attendees, you can see a sorted list of who attended the resource. (Names can be repeated in this list if the same person attended twice.) Here, you can also delete a resource – only if there are no attendees (to preserve data integrity). You can also add a new resource as well.</p>

<p>Second, use Flight Tracker to track attendance. You can track it on the computer during the resource or by using a roster after the resource. Click on the Resources menu and the Participation Roster item. Select the resource you wish to track.</p>

<p>There are three lists. The one on the left is one where you type. Every time you hit return in this column, the computer attempts to match the name against the names in the database. When a match appears, it appears on the line in the second column. Only matched names will save the resource attendance and only when <b>Add Names</b> is clicked (at the bottom). Clicking this button will move the matched names into the third column (on the right) and will save the names in the database. The third column indicates the roster of all who have already signed in for the day (and only for that day); this includes names that have already been added by previous clicks of the Add Names button.</p>

<p>Third, use the analytical tools to display simple metrics. Visit the <b>Resources</b> menu and click <b>Dashboard Metrics</b>. (Alternately, you could also look at the <b>Dashboards</b> menu and click <b>Resources</b>.) This dashboard will provide you with the total number of attendees over time as well.</p>

<p>Fourth, while at resources dashboard, you can select a previously designed cohort to provide advanced analysis. You can track the attendance of a given set of people.</p>
