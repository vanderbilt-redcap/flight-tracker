<h3>Designing Cohorts</h3>

<p>Instead of looking only at your overall population, you might want to look at statistics for a subset of the population (in other words, a cohort). To assist with doing so, you can consult the Cohorts / Filtering menu, which has the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Add a Cohort</b>. This page will allow you to specify the characteristics of a cohort. You can specify up to 5 filters and specify the Boolean logic â€“ whether to AND these together or whether to OR them together. You can filter based on demographic information, grants, publications, or resource participation. Click <b>Add Row</b> to add each condition, and click <b>Commit Filter</b> to complete your cohort when you are done.</b></li>
<p><img src='img/cohortDesign1.png' alt='Add Cohort page'></p>
<li><b>View Existing Cohorts</b>. This page shows the characteristics of each cohort. By clicking on <b>Show Names</b>, the names of scholars in the cohort can be viewed. Clicking on <b>Export Names</b> will export a text-file of names in the cohort. If you add new scholars to the database, they will automatically be added to each cohort if they fulfill the characteristics requirements.</li>
<p><img src='img/cohortDesign2.png' alt='View Cohorts page'></p>
<li><b>Manage Cohorts</b>. This page serves two functions: to rename a cohort and to delete a cohort.</li>
<li><b>Cohort Profiles</b>. This page provides a quick profile of each cohort. It displays the number of scholars in the cohort, the number of grants in the cohort, the total number of grant budget dollars in the cohort, and the total number of confirmed original publications.</li>

<li><b>Export a Cohort</b>. This exports the names for a given cohort in the same manner as on the <b>View Existing Cohorts</b> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you can access specific metrics for each cohort in the Dashboards section. (See <a href='launchHelp("useCaseCohortMetrics.html");'>Cohort Metrics</a> for more information.)</p>
