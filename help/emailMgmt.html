<h3>Managing Group Emails</h3>

<p>On occasion, administrators need to contact a group of scholars. Other times, administrators need to send a survey to collect information such as demographics, but they don't want to over-survey their scholars.</p>

<p><img src='img/emailMgmt1.png' alt='Email Management interface'></p>

<p>Flight Tracker offers some basic filters to achieve this. The left-hand column contains the information about the <b>Who?</b> The first question deals with whether you want to apply a filter or manually check off individual names from a list.</p>

<p>A filter will present you with a list of questions to answer. To avoid “over-surveying,” many of these questions deal with how often you have surveyed a given scholar. Another set of filters groups scholars by grant status, such as one that includes only those currently on a K grant,  or those who have not yet converted to an R01-or -equivalent grant regardless of whether they currently have a K or not.</p>

<p>The list of names currently a part of your group will show. The system will recalculate the list <b>at the scheduled time of the email</b> to ensure even scholars who have newly become part of that group are included.</p>

<p>The <b>What?</b> section consists of an email subject and an email message. The following fields can be piped into a message from your data: name, last name, and a personalized link to a survey.</p>

<p>The <b>When?</b> section allows you to schedule your email. This time is approximate as REDCap will send the emails after all of its other tasks have completed. Most times, this process only delays a send by a few seconds.</p>

<p>You will have to <b>Advance the Process</b> by staging the email in order to test it. This process consists of three steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first step saves the email in order to stage it.</li>
<li>The second step sends a group of emails to you (or some other email address) in order to test it. Because customized name and survey-link fields can be used, one email per participant on the list will be sent to you. (Be prepared for a lot of emails if your list is long.) We suggest testing the links in five-to-ten percent of the emails to ensure that the links and the data-piping are working as expected.</li>
<li>After the emails have been tested, you can press <b>Activate Emails & Enqueue to Send</b>. This enables the email to be processed. <b>If you do not complete this step, your email will not be sent!</b></li>
</ol>
