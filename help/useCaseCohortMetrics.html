<h3>Use Case: Cohort Metrics</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: Someone asks for the conversion percentage of people who have had a K since 2012.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: First, form a cohort with the proper characteristics (those who started on a K since 2012). We will go to the <b>Cohorts / Filtering</b> menu and select <b>Add a New Cohort</b>. The <b>Filter Type</b> is Grant; the <b>Variable</b> is Last Any K; and the value is &gt; 01/01/2012. Click <b>Commit Filter</b>.</p>

<p>Second, after clicking <b>Commit Filter</b>, we will see a list of scholars who qualify for our cohort. From the outset, we can hypothesize that a large percentage of people in the cohort should still be on their K (at least for this document written mid-year in 2019). We can click <b>View Cohort Metrics</b>. We can select our cohort from the dropdown. We are then taken to the <b>Overall Summary</b> dashboard. We see a conversion percentage under <b>Converted (Overall)</b>.</p>

<p>This is not as precise of a method as using the <b>K2R Conversion Calculator</b> (see <a href='launchHelp("useCaseConversion.html");'>Use Case: K&rarr;R Conversion</a>). The Calculator provides more control over variables. However, the Calculator works only for the entire population, not for a cohort.</p>
