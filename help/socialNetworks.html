<h3>Social Networks</h3>

<p>Social Network graphs (also called chord diagrams) are helpful for showing relationships of collaboration between many parties. In our case, the parties are scholars, and the relationships are either publishing a paper together or investigating a grant together by being co-PIs.</p>

<p>Some terminology has been defined to ease with communicating about these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The “network” is either all of the scholars or the cohort of scholars you’ve selected.</li>
    <li>A “collaborator” is a scholar in the network or, if requested, a mentor of a scholar.</li>
    <li>Collaborations are directional. Citations are “received from” a scholar, “given to” another collaborator (a scholar or mentor). In the graph, mentors cannot initiate a collaboration because their publications are not tracked.</li>
    <li>A “connection” is one publication/grant made together between two collaborators in the network. A connection must be begun by a scholar (“received from”) and “given to” a collaborator (either a scholar or mentor). (Two mentors cannot connect to each other. Mentors’ publications and grants are not tracked.) Graphically, a connection is a directional edge between two nodes.</li>
    <li>The total connections is the sum total of papers co-authored between a scholar and a collaborator, for each scholar in the network. Graphically, it is the total number of directional edges in a graph.</li>
    <li>Superlatives are outstanding individuals in your network. These are noted in the statistics. Outstanding metrics are the maximum number of collaborators and the maximum number of connections.</li>
    <li>Authorship position or position in the list of a grant is not considered in the social network graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, a bar chart is provided to chart the number of connections over time. The x-axis is year, and the y-axis is the number of connections.</p>
