<h3>What Can Be Changed?</h3>

<p>Flight Tracker is meant to be modified for each institution’s individual purposes. However, in the long run, we'd like to aggregate de-identified data across institutions in order to better assess what career development practices work best. In order to compare apples to apples in statistical analysis, Flight Tracker must maintain an inner core that is essentially the same from institution to institution.</p>

<h4>Features Open to Modification</h4>
<ul>
<li>Flight Tracker Configurations - Flight Tracker provides several configuration pages.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>General &rarr; Configure Application</li>
	<li>General &rarr; Configure Summaries</li>
	<li>Wrangle &rarr; Lexical Translator</li>
	</ul>
<li>Survey settings in REDCap (this adjusts things like the header text of a survey, not the questions themselves)</li>
<li>Dropdown and radio choices in REDCap fields</li>
<li>Brand logo</li>
<li>Additional surveys</li>
<li>Additional questions on surveys</li>
<li>Additional forms from other data sources</li>
<li>Additional custom PHP Code (please coordinate with <a href='mailto:scott.j.pearson@vumc.org'>Scott Pearson</a>)</li>
<li>Wording of questions on data forms (but not surveys that go to scholars).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Features whose Modification is Strongly Discouraged</h4>
<ul>
<li>Please do not change the way the questions are worded. If you want a change, please suggest it via the feedback form. Changing the wording of survey questions can potentially bias future analysis when data is aggregated.</li>
<li>Please do not delete any questions.</li>
<li>Please do not delete any choices in a dropdown, except for fields ending in _source. (You can delete data sources that might be specific to Vanderbilt’s set up.)</li>
<li>Please do not modify any coordinated PHP code unless coordinated with the Vanderbilt authors.</li>
</ul>
