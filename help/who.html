<h3>Who should use Flight Tracker for Scholars (CareerDev)?</h3>

<p>Flight Tracker for Scholars has four intended audiences (which may overlap):</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Administrators and Program Managers</b> who make biomedical research centers run.
<li><b>Leaders</b> who seek to make smarter decisions informed by data.
<li><b>Researchers</b> who seek deeper insight into populations of their scholars and of scholars nationally.
<li><b>Software Developers</b> who seek to extend this software to meet the informatics needs of their institutions.
</ol>

<p>Agents from these four groups are meant to interface with the software and should be added to the REDCap project so that they can gain access to the software.</p>

<p>Notably missing in this list are the scholars themselves. They comprise the subjects of our common studies. Through surveys and verification of their accomplishments, they provide important data about themselves so that we can understand our practices better. However, this software is about providing a supporting environment so that they can succeed better. As such, individual scholars do not need access to the populationâ€™s data. We have streamlined workflows so as to cause minimal intrusion upon their important work.</p>
