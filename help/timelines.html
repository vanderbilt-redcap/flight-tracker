<h3>Timelines</h3>

<p>Flight Tracker relies upon the overnight processes which fetch information from various sources. Also supplemented are data from surveys. Both of these take some time to percolate through the system. While the data are summarized every night, manual curation (i.e., data wrangling) is still required to get everything into the desired shape.</p>

<p>While minimal effort is required to set up this application, some waiting is also required. It is <b>strongly recommended</b> that you start your database at least <b>one month</b> before you need the results. This application helps to collect all of the data necessary for deeper analysis. The answers in analysis come with time and also with good data integrity.</p>

<p>The tasks to set up the database are:</p>
<ol>
<li>On day one, entering all the names and email addresses.</li>
<li>After two weeks, ensuring that surveys are sent out.</li>
<li>After two weeks, verifying publications in the Publication Wrangler.</li>
<li>After two weeks, verifying grants and their given categories in the Grant Wrangler.</li>
</ol>

<p>The tasks to maintain the database are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once a month, verifying new publications in the Publication Wrangler.</li>
<li>Once a month, verifying new grants and their given categories in the Grant Wrangler.</li>
<li>Adding new scholars as new individual records when they meet criteria for entry into your database. At Vanderbilt, we begin tracking scholars when they receive their first career development award (internal K, K12, or individual K/K-equivalent). Once you add a new scholar, the processes for gathering grants and publications and sending out the initial survey begin automatically.</li>
