<h3>Use Case: Publications</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: You want to track the publishing record of your scholars, but you are confused how to do so since different academic fields have different publishing practices.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: The NIH launched <a href='https://icite.od.nih.gov/'>iCite</a> to calculate bibliometrics for publication information. It is correlated with PubMed IDs (PMIDs). Every week, we download that information for all our publications. That information is available individually in REDCap via the <b>Citation</b> form.</p>

<p>There are three measurements of note. First, the <b>Field Citation Rate</b> tracks the average citation rate for one’s field. The field consists of the articles cited by the paper, and the journal citation rates are used for the average. Second, the <b>Relative Citation Rate (RCR)</b> is the number of the citations of an article divided by the Field Citation Rate; thus, the RCR is field-normalized. The RCR is observed to stabilize and to remain stabilized after two years (i.e., 24 months). Third, iCite uses PubMed Publication Types to discern whether an article is or isn’t <b>Original Research</b>.</p>

<p>A Scholar’s Profile lists the average RCR of her/his papers, both of all papers and of all papers over 24 months old. These can be compared to other scholars to provide a metric of scholastic impact.</p>
