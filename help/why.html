<h3>Why use the Flight Tracker for Scholars?</h3>

<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>Grant applications and annual progress reports often ask for data about an institution’s scholars. Some of this information is publicly available through resources like PubMed or the NIH RePORTER, but these data take time to compile and often lack important elements such as non-federal grants. Flight Tracker is meant to be an application and a tool to make this compilation easier, more efficient, and more accurate.</p>

<p>Flight Tracker takes a small amount of time to set up and a few weeks of waiting for data to populate. The software is intended to be run year-round and to be manually curated in regular intervals to keep the data current. Given that small investment of time, tools and reports can quickly provide what you’re looking for.</p>

<h4>Scalable</h4>
<p>Flight Tracker can track populations as small as a few scholars as well as populations as large as hundreds of scholars. The scholars listed should have their publications available on PubMed and their grants on NIH RePORTER. The overnight processes are scheduled to run at times when servers and networks typically experience downtimes so that they will pose a minimal burden to infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Data-Driven</h4>
<p>Data are stored and available in the secure environment of REDCap. Thus, quick analysis can take place. Well-known in the research community, REDCap  is a secure, web-based software platform. It serves as the storage infrastructure of Flight Tracker. In addition, REDCap’s interface can be used to view and analyze data from Flight Tracker.</p>

<p class='smaller'>The relationship of the two applications is more of symbiosis than coexistence – that is, without REDCap Flight Tracker could not run. Flight Tracker extends REDCap, and REDCap allows for the extension of Flight Tracker. (See Extending for more information.)</p>

<p>The basic idea of Flight Tracker is to keep a running ledger of information about scholars as they develop their biomedical careers. When you need critical information about your scholars, it is available quickly and accurately through a few clicks of the mouse instead of through complicated hand-sorting of data in spreadsheets or across multiple data sources.</p>

<h4>Simplicity</h4>
<p>This application transforms a small amount of simple data (a list of scholars and email addresses) into automated surveys, the automated data collection of grants and publications, and analytical tools that can solve real problems. This tool is meant to assist with the administration of the career development of academics with a particular eye on reporting.</p>

<p>The Flight Tracker for Scholars’s power resides in processes that run overnight about once a week. The data are thus almost as up-to-date as the original data sources are. Each data point is reported in a summary that is re-calculated each night, and metadata (data about data) about the source and type of information are stored for each data point.</p>

<p>Instead of manually curating complex reports through difficult spreadsheets, the administration of careers thus becomes the maintenance of a simple database, most of which is automated.</p>

<h4>Track Scholar Progress</h4>
<p>Worrying about scholars achieves very little. Unfortunately, a lack of data can exist that measures their performance. This software allows you to see where your investments are paying off and to identify where those investments might merit further attention. (See Diagnose Problems Earlier.) It allows you to celebrate scholars that not only “make it” but also thrive with their new challenges. It allows you to celebrate resources and mentors who provide the support infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Diagnose Problems Earlier</h4>
<p>All data are updated automatically once a week. This allows you to see the latest information for each scholar. Therefore, it becomes easier to identify which scholars might be falling behind the pace. An intervention can take place to identify the reasons behind the lagging. Hopefully, measures can be enacted to rectify the situation. Without easy and early detection, nothing remdial can be done.</p>

<p>Further, with some programmer effort, you have the ability to extend the application to interact with your local data repositories. If your local data contain information on grant submissions, you can track integrate those in with Flight Tracker to provide an even bigger picture of scholar progress and problems. This would allow you to intervene in difficult situations sooner – a savings in time that just might help a few more scholars achieve their dreams and our dreams.</p>

<h4>Identify Trends</h4>
<p>The field of Academic Career Development is both very important and poorly understood. It has immense impact. We invest heavily in our scholars, but we do not monitor our investments closely. This software seeks to allow us to build on identified good practices and ameliorate the weaker practices. Through multi-site data aggregation (which is currently just a dream of this software), it can be used in research to identify common national trends across institutions. It is our hope that data from this software unlocks insights that will advance the field of academic career development for the next generation of management on scholarship.</p>
