<h3>Use Case: Searches</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: Someone asks who in your group is interested in the research topic of Atrial Fibrillation.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: While there are other options, we’re going to use Flight Tracker for Scholars’s data to find this out. On the front page, there are two search fields, one for publications and one for grants. For our second and third options, we could potentially make use of both of these. A scholar might reference “atrial fibrillation” in a grant proposal and also in a publication citation. Let’s try both of these options.</p>

<p><img src='img/useCaseSearches1.png' alt='Front page picture'></p>

<p>Let’s type “Atrial Fibrillation” in the box next to <b>Search Grants</b> and then click the accompanying button. This performs a case-insensitive search of the Grants you have downloaded and summarized. Only grants that have been “binned” or given a type are consulted. The records and scholars that have grants (past and prior) with the words “atrial fibrillation” in their title are shown. The REDCap records are provided in the link in case we want to explore more deeply.</p>

<p>While searching the grants will show us scholars who are actively researching this issue, we might be interested in others who are not (yet) writing grants in this field. Therefore, let’s go back to the front page and search the publications. Let’s type in “Atrial Fibrillation” in the text-box next to <b>Search Publications</b> and click the button. This will again perform a case-insensitive search of the citations (but not the abstract nor the full article) that we have downloaded from PubMed.</p>

<p><img src='img/useCaseSearches3.png' alt='Picture of publication results'></p>

<p>This resulting list shows the citations that matched. We also can note the number of scholars which show up in this search. As with our grant search, links to the citation data are provided as well. In addition, if a PubMed ID is associated with the citation, we can go to PubMed to view the abstract (and perhaps the published paper). From here, we can form our own list of scholars that are active in publishing in the atrial-fibrillation space.</p>
