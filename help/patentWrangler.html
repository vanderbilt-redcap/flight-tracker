<h3>Manual Curation: Patent Wrangler</h3>

<p>Patent Wrangling in Flight Tracker is essentially the second step of Publication Wrangling. (In fact, it uses the same code.) Patents are likewise matched from the US Patent Office’s PatentView by name and institution. False positives can occur, so they need to be checked off individually. It’s an <i>opt-in</i> process. Fortunately, new patents are usually less frequent than publications. All records without a downloaded patent are skipped.</p>
