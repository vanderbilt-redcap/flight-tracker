<h3>Grant Binning Definitions</h3>

<p>In addition, the overnight script places each grant into one of many <b>bins</b>. These bins can be used to group things for analysis. The exact algorithm used to place grants into these bins is available in the Codebook. The bins are:
<ul>
<li>Internal K – A starter grant by the institution, funded with internal dollars. The application defaults to three-year terms for these grants. (This can be configured by visiting the <i>General</i> menu and clicking <i>Configure Application</i>.) These grants are different from startup packages and may not exist at all institutions.</li>
<li>K12/KL2 – A "group K," using federal dollars but administered internally, with a senior faculty PI and multiple scholars supported at 75% effort.</li>
<li>Individual K – From the NIH, typically five years in length and supports 75% of a scholar's effort.</li>
<li>External K – A career development grant from an external source such as the VA or a foundation, but not NIH; typically covers 50-75% of a scholar's effort and ranges from three to five years in length.</li>
<li>R01 – NIH's large project grant. Either an R01 or an R01 Equivalent is required for a scholar to “convert” to research independence.</li>
<li>R01 Equivalent – Defined as $250,000 per year for 3+ years  from any non-NIH source; either an R01 or an R01 Equivalent is required for a scholar to “convert.”</li>
<p class='smaller blockquote'>Over 90% of R01s given nationally fit this definition based on all R01s listed in the NIH RePORTER from 2013-2017. Two other definitions of R01 equivalence were considered and not used. One definition from the NIH with certain activity codes of awards was not used because the definition did not encompass non-NIH grants. Another definition from Cancer.gov of $125,000 per year over three years was not used because $250,000 per year was closer to a data-determined response.</p>
<li>Research Fellowship – We allow this category to be used by a Custom Grant as it is helpful for classification of some grants that may otherwise get incorrectly lumped into one of the K bins. Our algorithm does not place a grant into this category automatically, however; it is used only in manual placement. F30/31/32 grants and similar fellowships use this prior to a scholar's career development (K) award.</li>
<li>Mentoring/Training Grant Admin – This category is used when someone administrates (i.e., is a PI) a grant (e.g., T32 or K12) being used to train other prospective investigators. Typically only those who have converted from K to R and are at the Associate Professor level or higher can be PI on these grants.</li>
<li>Bridge Awards – For K99/R00 and F99/K00 grants. We had trouble with classifying these paired grants as they are more than just a career development award but not at the level of an R01 or equivalent. Therefore, we put in its own category. Being given this grant is not considered “conversion” from K to R, but these are not considered K grants either; essentially this takes awardees out of the denominator of those who have or have had a K.</li>
<li>N/A – All other grants; these grants are not placed in the fifteen most recent grants. Examples include internally generated grants where someone else is the PI or small external grants or contracts which do not meet the level of funding for an R01 Equivalent, such as an R03 or R21.</li>
</ul>
