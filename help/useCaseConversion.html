<h3>Use Case: K&rarr;R Conversion</h3>

<p><b>Situation</b>: For a grant application, your office is asked the percent of scholars who convert from a career development award to R01 or equivalent awards.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: This situation is so common that Flight Tracker has a special configuration page with special results. It is located in the <b>K2R Conversion Calculator</b> in the menu titled <b>General</b>.</p>

<p>First, look at the top item that calculates the conversion ratio. There are several input parameters that you might tweak depending on the request. Default values are provided.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exclude those within X years of receipt of most recent K who have not converted: The number you enter in the field excludes anyone who is still within that many years of receiving their most recent K. This prevents your conversion ratio from becoming artificially small by including those who have not realistically had time to go from K to R from being included in the denominator.</li>
<li>Type of K: You can select which types of K to focus on—internal, K12/KL2, individual K, K equivalent, or various combinations, including any and all Ks.</li>
<li>Start Countdown At: Typically, the countdown for inclusion in the denominator (above) is reset with every K award. Therefore, we usually set this value to Last K.</li>
<li>R01-and-Equivalents vs. R01s Only: Typically, we allow for R01 Equivalents to be considered.</li>
</ul>

<p class='smaller blockquote'>In our code, an R01 Equivalent award is defined as $250,000 of direct costs per year and over a project timespan of three-or-more years.</p>

<p>Second, after clicking <b>Calculate</b>, it’s important to interpret the results properly. Depending on your input parameters, the specific stipulations are presented. All K99/R00s and F99/R00s are excluded because they seem to indicate an alternate pathway. The number most sought is the top number – the conversion ratio. Average ages at various points on the conversion timeline are also provided.</p>

<p>Going back to the original page, if you are interested in seeing who is currently on a K, you can use the bottom portion entitled <b>Who is on a K Award?</b></p>
