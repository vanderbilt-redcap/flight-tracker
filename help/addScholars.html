<h3>Adding New Scholars</h3>
<p><img src='img/addScholars1.png' alt='Picture of Wrangle menu'></p>

<p>To add a scholar, select <b>Add a New Scholar</b> in the Scholars menu. Enter her/his first name, last name, and email address, and click the button. Obviously, incorrect spelling of any of these fields will result in a silent and undetectable error, so you need to double-check the spelling. When the button is pressed, a new record will be added to the REDCap database.</p>

<p>Names will be matched to the data sources (like the Federal RePORTER, the NIH ExPORTER, and PubMed), so use whatever form the scholar would use to apply for grants and to publish. Nicknames and alternate names can be placed in parentheses as can maiden names. Hyphenated last names are supported.</p>

<ul>
<li>Grant and publication data on the scholar will be collected. These data are stored in <b>repeating instances</b> of forms. These data will need to be <b>wrangled</b> by the <b>Grant Wrangler</b> and the <b>Publication Wrangler</b> (see <a href='launchHelp("pubWrangler.html");'>Publication Wrangler</a>).</li>
<li>The data will be summarized every night and updated in the <b>Summary form</b>.</li>
</ul>
